Hi! My name is Nikolay. I am a frontend developer. I have experience in website layout for over two years. Mostly non-commercial, but for the last year has been engaged in commercial projects.
I have a great desire to develop further in this area, and the opportunity to show and improve my knowledge, to become the best is my main goal in my work.

My strengths include teamwork skills, a desire to find the most effective and beautiful solution, the ability to independently seek resources to help solve a problem or improve my professional level, a strong interest in interface development.

Development technologies:
- HTML, CSS
- SAAS/SCSS
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- Docker
- VueJS
- React
- NodeJS
- PHP
- MongoDB
